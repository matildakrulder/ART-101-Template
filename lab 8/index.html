      <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Work with partners to create a callback functions that appear in
          the console in a specific order.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>When we ran the tests in our console there was no space in between
        the test number and the text. This didn't look good so we put a space
        at the begining of each string.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Go to the console to see our results!</p>
